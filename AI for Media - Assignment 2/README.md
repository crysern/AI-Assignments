# Reflection:

The images interpolated between two points in the latent space seem to have similar qualities. It is likely because the latentspace encodes certain qualities of the images that are visually similar. It could account for image similarity. From a colourperspective, the dataset consists of Jellyfish that live predominantly in water and the likelihood that all photographs were takenwhen the body of water appeared blue is highly likely.


Describe a creative piece or creative industry use case in which this model might be useful?

A considerable movement we have seen is that in the space of generative art and NFTs, this has exploded in the last fewyears.
The creation of new digital assets has made art more accessible to the masses; these generative methods have alsoallowed for more unique/one of a kind value to be purchased by anyone.

What are the advantages and disadvantages over current non generative methods?

# The Advantages:

1. There are many advantages to using generative methods over current non-generative methods:


2. Generative methods are much more efficient in terms of memory usage.


3. They can often produce better quality results than non-generative methods.


4. Scalability, meaning that they can be used to generate more complex results on larger data sets.


# The Disadvantages:


1. Generative methods can be more complex and challenging to understand and use.

2. They can be slower to generate results than non-generative methods.

3. They are expensive to implement in terms of computational resources.
